# Orchestration
Managing each container is a tough task. Microservices must be run synchronously. Because,

they can communicate with each other
when one of them is failed, it must be handled automatically
etc.
Orchestration tools are used to manage containers.

> Kubernetes, docker swarm etc. are some orchestration tools.
