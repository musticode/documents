## Five Point Plan for starting Test Automation

The following five point test automation plan will help the test team in easily implementing the test automation for the software under development:

1. Create Automation Plan

2. Check stability of the application for test automation

3. Check for critical test scenarios that could be a good fit for automation

4. Prioritize the tests as per the critical test journeys of the product

5. Work step by step to add the test scenarios to the test automation suite

### Create Test Automation Plan

The first point is to create an automation plan that will help the team to understand the following:

- Application platform to be automated like Web, Mobile or API
- Test Objective â€” Functional, Visual, Performance, Security, etc
- Features to be automated
- Scope of test automation
- Time frame to complete test automation
- Tools/Frameworks to be used
- Entry and Exit Criteria
- Who all will be participating in the test automation
- Test Environment and Test Data
- Test cases including expected and actual output with test steps

The plan should provide a brief overview about the test automation. It will also help the test team to track the progress and check for the deviations, if any. It is recommended to get it reviewed by the team leads, product owners and get it approved by them.
